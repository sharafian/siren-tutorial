<h1>Web Monetization Quick Start</h1>

<p>To get started with Web Monetization, you'll be taken through these three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an XRP wallet</li>
<li>Get a "Payment Pointer" on Siren</li>
<li>Add the Web Monetization script to your website.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you complete these steps, you'll be able to monetize your site traffic to
receive live XRP.</p>

<h3>Create an XRP Wallet</h3>

<p><strong>If you have an exchange account:</strong> Find your XRP deposit address. There will
be an address that looks like <code>rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx</code> and a
<strong>destination tag</strong> number that looks like <code>123456</code>, for instance.</p>

<p><strong>If you don't have an exchange account:</strong> You can use the <a href="https://toastwallet.com/">Toast
Wallet</a> to create an XRP address. Follow their
instructions until you've created a wallet. Make sure you back up your secret!</p>

<p>When you've created your wallet, you'll have an address that looks something
like <code>rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx</code>. This is your <strong>XRP Address</strong>.</p>

<h3>Get a Payment Pointer on Siren</h3>

<p>Now that you have an XRP address, you can easily receive money through Siren.
The identifier that you use to receive money with Interledger is called a
<strong>Payment Pointer</strong>. It starts with a <code>$</code>, then a domain, and then an optional
path. Your payment pointer will be based on Siren's domain, so you don't need
to run anything yourself.</p>

<p><strong>If you have an exchange account</strong> then your payment pointer is
<code>$spsp.siren.sh/YOUR_XRP_DEPOSIT_ADDRESS/YOUR_DESTINATION_TAG</code></p>

<p>So if your XRP deposit address were <code>rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx</code>, and
your destination tag were <code>123456</code>, your payment pointer would be:</p>

<p><code>$spsp.siren.sh/rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx/123456</code>.</p>

<p><strong>If you don't have an exchange account:</strong> Your payment pointer is:
<code>$spsp.siren.sh/YOUR_XRP_ADDRESS</code>.</p>

<p>So if your XRP address were <code>rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx</code>, your payment
pointer would be:</p>

<p><code>$spsp.siren.sh/rsKguPpyAZhpHqGyP8A3xu7Acsk3PF8zyx</code>.</p>

<h3>Add the Web Monetization Script to Your Website</h3>

<p>Add the following tag to your site's body. Make sure to replace
<code>YOUR_PAYMENT_POINTER</code> with your payment pointer.</p>

<pre>
&lt;script>
  if (window.monetize) {
    monetize({
      receiver: 'YOUR_PAYMENT_POINTER'
    })
      .then(() => {
        // You can insert code here to thank the user
      })
  }
&lt;/script>
</pre>
